# API & NLP Extension (Optional)

## Overview

This optional extension demonstrates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and API-style processing can be applied on top of an existing SQL and ETL-based analytics pipeline.

The project reuses customer feedback data stored in a SQLite database generated by the main ETL workflow and focuses on text-based analytical enhancement rather than modifying the original pipeline.

This module is intended as a **bonus analytical extension** for portfolio demonstration and technical review.

## Project Objective

- Extend structured SQL analytics into text-based insights  
- Demonstrate basic NLP techniques applicable to customer feedback analysis  
- Illustrate an API-style data processing pattern without external dependencies  

---

## Key Features

- Sentiment polarity analysis on customer comments  
- Keyword frequency extraction for qualitative insight discovery  
- Simulated API-style response output for downstream integration scenarios  
- Independent execution without altering the core ETL or SQL projects  

---

## Technical Stack

- Python  
- SQLite  
- Pandas  
- TextBlob (sentiment analysis)  
- Matplotlib (optional visualization output)  

---

## Data Source

- SQLite database generated by the **Data Parsing & ETL Analysis** project  
- Input data consists of structured customer feedback records and text comments  

---

## Execution Notes

- No external API tokens are required  
- No production API calls are made (API behavior is simulated)  
- Designed for code review, demonstration, and conceptual evaluation  
- Focuses exclusively on text analytics (no image or multimedia processing)  

---

## What This Demonstrates

- Ability to extend SQL-based workflows with NLP-driven insights  
- Understanding of analytics pipeline layering and modular design  
- Practical application of Python for text analysis  
- Clean separation between core data engineering logic and analytical extensions
